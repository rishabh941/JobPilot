## üêõ Troubleshooting

### "Nothing is showing" at the scraper page

**Check the URL:**
- ‚úÖ Correct: `http://localhost:5173/scraper`
- ‚ùå Wrong: `http://localhost:5173/sccraper` (double 'c')

**Check if frontend is running:**
```powershell
# Should show "VITE ready" message
cd jobpilot-dashboard
npm run dev
```

**Check browser console (F12):**
- Look for any error messages
- Check Network tab for failed requests

### "Connection refused" or "Failed to start scraping"

**Cause:** Backend services not running

**Check FastAPI (Port 5000):**
```powershell
curl http://localhost:5000/docs
```

**Check Spring Boot (Port 8080):**
```powershell
curl http://localhost:8080/api/jobs
```

**Start missing services:**
```powershell
# FastAPI
cd jobpilot-scraper\naukri
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000 --reload

# Spring Boot
cd demo
.\mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run
```

### Scraping is very slow or times out

**Causes:**
- Too many pages selected
- Slow internet connection
- Naukri.com is slow/down

**Solutions:**
- Start with 1-2 pages
- Check internet connection
- Try again later
- Use fewer filters

### "No new jobs found"

**Causes:**
- All matching jobs already in database
- Filters too restrictive
- No jobs available for that criteria

**Solutions:**
- Remove experience filter
- Remove posted date filter
- Try different location
- Try different role
- Increase number of pages

### Jobs not showing in Jobs page

**Possible causes:**
- Jobs were duplicates (already in database)
- Database connection issue
- Need to refresh the page

**Solutions:**
- Refresh the Jobs page (F5)
- Check if jobs exist: `http://localhost:8080/api/jobs`
- Check MongoDB connection

## üìä Understanding the Results

### Duplicate Handling
The system automatically prevents duplicate jobs using a hash of:
- Job Title
- Company Name
- Location

If a job already exists, it won't be added again.

### Job Status
All newly scraped jobs have status: **"pending"**

You can update status to:
- **"applied"** - After you apply
- **"failed"** - If application failed

### Job Data
Each scraped job contains:
- Title
- Company
- Location
- Experience required
- Skills
- Posted date
- Job URL (link to Naukri)
- Job type (Full-time, Part-time, etc.)
- Seniority level (Entry, Mid, Senior)
- Category (Software Development, etc.)

## üìù Tips for Best Results

1. **Start Small**
   - Begin with 1-2 pages
   - Test with broad filters

3. **Popular Locations**
   - Use common city names
   - "Bengaluru" or "Bangalore" both work
   - "Mumbai" not "Bombay"

4. **Experience Filters**
   - Use if you want targeted results
   - Leave empty for all levels
   - Fresher? Use "0-1 years"

5. **Posted Date**
   - "Last 7 days" for recent jobs
   - Leave empty for all jobs
   - Older jobs may already be filled

6. **Number of Pages**
   - 1-2 pages for quick test
